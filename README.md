# ‚òÄÔ∏è FloodWeather - Fullstack Capstone Project

FloodWeather is a full-stack weather application created as the final project for the Fullstack Capstone Course. It provides real-time radar and infrared satellite data to visualize weather conditions and potential flooding risks. The project was initially built using vanilla ES6 JavaScript and has now been modernized and converted to SvelteKit, a modern web framework based on Svelte.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used / Plan to use

- **Frontend:** SvelteKit, HTML, CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js, Vite
- **APIs:** RainViewer API, Leaflet
- **Data Storage:** _TBD_
- **Deployment:** Vercel (Frontend), TBD (Backend)

## üñ•Ô∏è Project Overview

FloodWeather allows users to view both radar (past and future) and infrared satellite data on an interactive map. Users can switch between radar and satellite views and also control the color scheme of the weather data.

The application fetches real-time weather data using the RainViewer API. The data is then processed and visualized on a map, which is provided by Leaflet dependency. Users can navigate through the weather data using player controls to go backward, play, stop, or go forward in time. Additionally, the application provides options to customize the color scheme of the weather data for a personalized experience.
